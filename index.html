	<h3> ...Huh? </h3>
	<p> 	Oh, have you not heard of a Ghost? Also called an Ukagaka (伺か) or Nanika (何か), these desktop mascots originate from a series of Japanese basewares that run one or more characters that sit on a user’s desktop to provide aesthetic and entertainment in text bubbles, along with some helpful tasks and occasionally games. </p>
	<p> 	The only baseware still updated today would be SSP, which stands for SakuraScript Player, that can be found [right here.] After it is downloaded, the opening Ghost, Emily, will be able to download more Ghosts by having their files (a .nar extension) dragged and dropped onto her.</p>
	<p> 	Many Ghosts are in Japanese, since Japan of course is the origin of the program. However, many can be found in other languages, such as English, Chinese, German, Spanish, French, Russian, and more. Some Ghosts, such as Zarla’s Handplates Gaster, have numerous translations. Zarla has also made a wonderful video for more background on Ukagakas, which can be found [here.] It includes every English Ghost that she could find when the video was made, including two I have worked on: Zaiga and Nox. </p>
	<p> 	…the ‘all lines end here’ bit is because its a hub, and I think it’s fun. </p>
