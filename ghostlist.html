	<h3> My Contributions: Everything </h3>
	<p> In a distant, dystopian future, there is only one place left in the world: Atlas City. Twelve levels high, domed to protect from the air, and ruled entirely by a megacorporation called the Variation Organization of Cybernetics. Atlas City does have its problems, though, and one that the Variation Organization faces is how its artificial intelligence eventually gain sentience. It has brought an end to many uncompleted projects, and now one of them is here to pester you on your desktop.</p>

	<p> Maybe this isn't where they're supposed to be... but maybe it's for the best they're here with you. Here with you to respond to the aftermath of something... disastrous. They're better off with you. Right?</p>
	<p> Take good care of them.</p>
	<p> Perhaps you're all they'll have.</p>
	<p> Made for the 2022 Ukagaka Dream Team Disaster Jam.</p>
	<p> Includes in depth first aid mechanics, punching and petting mechanics, and some changes every so often.</p>

	<p> He'll sit around on your computer and be his shadowey self, but there's more than meets the eye! Ask him questions to learn about his interesting world, give him gifts (like mugs!), pet him, hit him, and subtly influence his world. Beware, too, there might be something else lurking-- I'd recommend clicking it a lot, and maybe it'll go away. </p>
